# ws-gitflow
Workshop on how to use Git for feature branching and running a project according to the [GitFlow]("http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/")</a> process.

Because Git works so well with text/code and we don't want any unnecessary complexity, we will use this readme.md as our base work document to learn the secrets of feature branching and GitFlow!
