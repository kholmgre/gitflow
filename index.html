					<h1>GitFlow Workshop</h1>
					<p>
						Workshop on how to use Git for feature branching and running a project according to the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">GitFlow</a> process.
					</p>
				</header>

				<section>
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						A core concept in Git is the concept of <b>branches</b>. On a personal, small-scale or fairly uncomplicated project you might not have the need to run separate branches. The case then is usually simply to <i>push to master</i>. But what should one do when working on big projects? The GitFlow process is one way of solving this issue.
					</p>

					<p>
						This workshop will focus on training us in the use of the well-established GitFlow model. Successful use of the GitFlow model will allow us to keep better track of our own changes, and ultimately provide a safer workflow for the collective master branch which will henceforth only receive reviewed code. GitFlow offers some additional structure to the more general "Feature Branch Workflow", but all in all they work pretty much the same way. The main difference could be stated that, in the GitFlow process, branches are also created for releases and hotfixes (and potentially other classes of important branches) beyond just the master and develop branches.
					</p>

					<p>
						Remember that Git is essentially just a logging system to determine where, what and in which context changes have taken place. When working on a larger project it makes sense to isolate any work you are doing from the work of others until your work is ready for review and subsequent integration into the overall, "master" copy of the project. The most common way of achieving this isolation is by working in a separate branch of the project.
					</p>

					<p>
						Because Git tracks changes in files, rather than <i>actual</i> files, <u>you don't (usually) need multiple sets of the project files</u>. However, what you need to do is make sure you work in the correct branch, so changes don't carry over straight away into another branch, like the develop or master branch.
					</p>

					<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
					<p>
						You should have a working understanding of how Git operates. You should also be practically able to add (stage), commit, merge, pull, fetch and push to a centralized Git repository before attempting this workshop.

					<h3>Setup</h3>
					<p>
						This workshop assumes that the following criteria is met.
					</p>

					<aside>
						<ul>

					<h2>Overview of commands</h2>
					<p>
						Much of what is going to happen in this workshop will be familiar to you. Below I've provided a list of the general commands and steps you will learn.
					</p>

					<aside>
						<ul>
							<li><code>git branch [some-branch]</code>Creates a new branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code>git branch -d [some-branch]</code>Deletes the branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code>git checkout [some-branch]</code>Switches to the branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code>git checkout -b [newbranch] [oldbranch]</code>Creates a new branch with the specified name (if it doesn't already exist) from a previous branch and switches to the new branch (example usage: "git checkout -b myfeature develop")</li>
							<li><code>git merge [mergefrom]</code>Merge the specified branch onto the current branch (example usage: "git merge develop")</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Structure of branches</h2>
					<p>
						text goes here
					</p>

					<aside>
						<ul>
							<li><b>master</b>: This should always be a stable branch with write access only by someone who has review responsibilities</li>
							<li><b>develop</b>: This should be the default working branch</li>
							<li><b>feature1</b>: Any additional features or individual work should be separated into their own branches (use a descriptive name, such as "animated-menu-items")...</li>
							<li><b>feature2</b>: ...so that all work is easily overviewed and isolated</li>
						</ul>

				<section>
					<h2><i>Detached HEAD</i></h2>
					<p>
						Someday you might encounter a warning about the branch you are working on having a detached HEAD. [...]
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2><span class="number">1.</span> Add a new feature branch</h2>
					<p>
						Only push to the "develop" branch and your own feature branch! You can list the current branches in the project with <code>git branch</code>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Switch to the development branch by running <code>git checkout develop</code>. You should now be on that specific branch, meaning all edits will be done only to that branch.
					</p>

					<h3>CLI</h3>
					<p>
						Add it by entering <code>git branch feature1 develop</code> into the CLI, and then switching to it with <code>git checkout feature1</code>. Switching to the master branch and listing changes with <code>git status</code> reveals that the master branch has no registered changes – all in good order!
					</p>

					<h3>GitHub</h3>
					<p>
						asdf
					</p>

					<h3>Bitbucket</h3>
					<p>
						asdf
					</p>

					<h3>Visual Studio 2015</h3>
					<p>
						In the Team Explorer's "Branches" view, right-click on the branch you want to branch out from, for example, "master". Click "New Local Branch From..." and enter the name of the new branch in the next screen. You can now switch between the branches by double-clicking on the one you wish to work on.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2><span class="number">2?</span> Add a new hotfix branch</h2>
					<p>
						Oftentimes, you will have to create a hotfix which may come as an abrupt surprise to your workday. Fear not! By creating a hotfix branch, we will attempt to quickly fix whatever is broken and base it entirely on stable master branch code.
					</p>

					<p>
						Switch to the development branch by running <code>git checkout develop</code>. You should now be on that specific branch, meaning all edits will be done only to that branch.
					</p>

					<h3>CLI</h3>
					<p>
						Add it by entering <code>git branch feature1 develop</code> into the CLI, and then switching to it with <code>git checkout feature1</code>. Switching to the master branch and listing changes with <code>git status</code> reveals that the master branch has no registered changes – all in good order!
					</p>

					<h2><span class="number">2.</span> Create pull request</h2>
					<h3>Only available via GUI</h3>
					<p>
						The <i>pull request</i> is used as a way to communicate that changes have taken place and that you wish these to be reviewed and added to the main branch (develop or master). A pull request should always contain a pertinent, meaningful description.
					</p>

					<h3>GitHub</h3>
					<p>
						asdf
					</p>

					<h3>Bitbucket</h3>
					<p>
						In Bitbucket there is a choice to "Close branch" after the pull request is merged. Click "Create pull request".
					</p>

					<h3>Visual Studio 2015</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/tutorial/pullrequest">More about pull requests</a> for VS2015, or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/pull-requests">read this</a> for some overview.
					</p>

					<p>
						Creating a pull request in VS2015 requires that you are <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/connect-to-visual-studio-team-services#vs">connected to Team Services</a>. When you have pushed a commit, you will see an update panel in the "Code" section of the TFS/VS web site - click on "Create a pull request".
					</p>

					<img src="img/tfs_pullrequest.png">

					<p>
						Make your comments in the view and request a pull. Approve or comment as needed in the Pull Requests view. When merging you may choose to delete the source branch. However, it doesn't seem like the local branch will be deleted.

					<h2><span class="number">3.</span> Merge a pull request</h2>
					<h3>Only available via GUI</h3>
					<p>
						The pull request is done in Bitbucket or another GUI. In Bitbucket you will find "Pull requests" on the left-hand side panel, under the "Navigation" heading.
					</p>

					<p>
						Valid users can "Approve" and "Unapprove" a pull request. The actual merge takes place when the "Merge" button is clicked. Make sure that "Source" and "Destination" are correct.
					</p>

					<h3>GitHub</h3>
					<p>
						asdf
					</p>

					<h3>Bitbucket</h3>
					<p>

					</p>

					<p>
						<b>NOTE</b>: In Bitbucket there is a choice to "Close source branch" in the "Merge pull request" panel. This eliminates the below step of erasing the remote (Bitbucket) repository.
					</p>

					<h3>Visual Studio 2015</h3>
					<p>
						In the Team Explorer's "Branches" view, right-click the develop (or master) branch and click "Merge From...". In "Merge from branch" simply choose which feature branch you want integrated into the develop (or master) branch. Finally, click "Merge" and make sure to Sync the merge.
