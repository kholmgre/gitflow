					<h1>GitFlow Workshop</h1>
					<p>
						Workshop on how to use Git for feature branching and running a project according to the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitFlow</a> process.
					</p>
				</header>

				<section>
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						A core concept in Git is the concept of <b>branches</b>. On a personal, small-scale or fairly uncomplicated project you might not have the need to run separate branches. The case then is usually simply to <i>push to master</i>. But what should one do when working on big projects? The <b>GitFlow</b> process is one way of solving this issue.
					</p>

					<img src="img/meme.jpg">

					<p>
						This workshop will focus on training us in the use of the well-established GitFlow model. Successful use of this model will allow us to keep better track of our own changes, and ultimately provide a safer workflow for the collective master branch which will henceforth only receive reviewed code. GitFlow offers some additional structure to the more general so-called <b>feature branch workflow</b>, but all in all they work pretty much the same way. The main difference could be stated that, <u>in the GitFlow process, branches are also used for releases and hotfixes</u> (and potentially other classes of important branches) beyond just the <code>master</code> and <code>develop</code> branches.
					</p>

					<p>
						Remember that Git is essentially just a logging system to determine where, what and in which context changes have taken place. When working on a larger project it makes sense to isolate any work you are doing from the work of others until your work is ready for review and subsequent integration into the overalls <code>master</code> branch of the project. The most common way of achieving this isolation is by working in a separate branch of the project.
					</p>

					<p>
						Because Git tracks <i>changes in files</i>, rather than <i>actual</i> files, <u>you don't (usually) need multiple sets of the project files</u>. However, what you need to do is <u>always make sure you work in the correct branch</u>, so changes don't carry over straight into another branch, like the <code>develop</code> or <code>master</code> branches.

					<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
					<p>
						This workshop assumes that the following criteria is met.
					</p>

					<aside>
						<ul>
							<li>You should have a working understanding of how Git operates</li>
							<li>You have sufficient practical skills to run basic Git tasks such as add (stage), commit, merge, pull, fetch and push to a remote Git repository</li>
							<li>You have cloned <a href="https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/ws-gitflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this workshop's repository</a> to your computer and have local access to all of its files</li>
							<li>You have set the above repository up to your own remote repository, with either a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/it/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">command line interface (CLI) with Git access</a>, <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/clone-a-repository-223217891.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitbucket</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/tutorial/clone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio 2015 (or later) with a Team Services account</a></li>
						</ul>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Overview of commands</h2>
					<p>
						Much of what is going to happen in this workshop will be familiar to you on some level. Below I've outlined the general CLI commands and steps you will learn in order to proficiently work with branches.
					</p>

					<p>
						If not using a CLI, any kind of Git GUI tool will have interactions corresponding to these commands.
					</p>

					<div class="inform">
						<h3>Don't use $ in your CLI</h3>
						<p>
							Please note that the dollar sign ($) always denotes the command line. Don't copy it into your CLI – use the rest of the text.
						</p>
					</div>

					<aside>
						<ul>
							<li><code>$ git branch [some-branch]</code>Creates a new branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code>$ git branch -d [some-branch]</code>Deletes the (local) branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code>$ git push origin --delete [some-branch]</code>Deletes the (remote) branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code>$ git checkout [some-branch]</code>Switches to the branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code>$ git checkout -b [newbranch] [oldbranch]</code><u>Creates a new branch</u> with the specified name (if it doesn't already exist) <u>from a previous branch</u> and <u>switches to the new branch</u><br>
								<b>Example usage</b>: <code>$ git checkout -b myfeature develop</code></li>
							<li><code>$ git merge [mergefrom]</code>Merge the specified branch onto the current branch<br>
								<b>Example usage</b>: <code>$ git merge develop</code>, meaning that if you are on <code>master</code>, then all the edits in <code>develop</code> will be added on top of your <code>master</code></li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Structure of branches</h2>
					<p>
						The following is how we will use branching in this workshop, which also corresponds to the overall GitFlow workflow.
					</p>

					<aside>
						<ul>
							<li><b>master</b>: This should always be a stable branch with write access only by someone who has review responsibilities</li>
							<li><b>develop</b>: This should be the <u>default ("unstable") working branch</u></li>
							<li><b>feature</b>: Any additional features or individual work should be separated into their own branches (use a descriptive name, such as "animated-menu-items") so that all work is easily overviewed and isolated; feature branches should be branched out from <code>develop</code></li>
							<li><b>hotfix</b>: Any urgent fixes that need to be stable should always be branched out from <code>master</code></li>
							<li><b>release</b>: All stable public releases go into their own separate release versions (for example according to <a href="http://semver.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semver</a>, such as 0.1 or 1.0 or 2.4.1) essentially <u>working only as an archive after they've been publicly released</u></li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Enter <code>$ git branch develop</code> and run <code>$ git branch</code> again. You will now see two branches and that <code>master</code> is highlighted.
						</p>

						<p>
							Try switching to the <code>develop</code> branch by entering <code>$ git checkout develop</code> and then <code>$ git branch</code>. Finally, return to the <code>master</code> so we can sync this with the remote.

					<h3>All</h3>
					<p>
						Make sure you are on the <code>facelift</code> branch.
					</p>

					<p>
						Open up readme.md in a text editor or IDE, and find the section called "Initial text". Copy the entire block of text and paste it above the previous "Initial text" block.
					</p>

					<p>
						Replace "Initial text" with "Feature" or something similar. Add three hash characters (#) before the "I" (signalling that this is a third-level heading in the Markdown language). Make sure there is a space between the third hash and the "I". Also, insert a line break between the two paragraphs so the text doesn't look so cramped.
					</p>

					<img src="img/text_feature.png">

					<p>
						If you run <code>$ git status</code> (or whatever similar functionality you have in your GUI), you should see that some changes have been made. Push our changes to the remote's <code>facelift</code> branch. The edit will now only be seen in readme.md on the <code>facelift</code> branch and not in any of the others.

					<h3>Only available via GUI</h3>
					<p>
						The <b>pull request</b> is used as a way to communicate to your team that changes have taken place and that you wish these to be reviewed and integrated into the main branch (<code>develop</code> or <code>master</code>). A pull request should therefore always contain a pertinent, meaningful description so others know what you've done.
					</p>

					<p>
						The changes we made and pushed to our own <code>facelift</code> branch are now uploaded, but unfortunately also contained and not integrated. What a shame that our nice styling is not available for others to see! &#x2639; Let's fix this.

				<section>
					<h2><span>1.</span> Add a new hotfix branch</h2>
					<p>
						Oftentimes, you will have to create a hotfix which may come as an abrupt surprise to your workday. Fear not! By creating a hotfix branch, we will attempt to quickly fix whatever is broken and base it entirely on stable <code>master</code> branch code.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this case, someone made a <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">derp</a> and totally missed that the dude in The Metamorphosis is Czech and not Swedish. Doh! Let's change Johan Andersson to Gregor Samsa to redeem ourselves. Oh - and we need to take care of this right away so no "oh, I'll do this thing here first" or "just one more game of Candy Crush plz :(".
					</p>

					<h3>All</h3>
					<p>
						First, we need to create a branch. We'll call it <code>hotfix-name</code> so we give at least some semantic context for what our fix is about. This procedure is identical to what we did in <a href="#task2">Task 2</a>. This time, however, you want to derive from the <code>master</code> branch, so the CLI command would be <code>$ git checkout -b hotfix-name master</code>.
					</p>

					<p>
						When it's been created, make sure you are on the <code>hotfix-name</code> branch.
					</p>

					<p>
						Open up readme.md in a text editor or IDE, and copy the section we worked on last time, called "Feature". Copy the entire block of text and paste it above the previous "Feature" block. // /// // use initial text block instead?
					</p>

					<p>
						Change the new block's heading to "Hotfix" or something similar. asdf.
					</p>

					<img src="img/text_feature.png">

					<p>
						If you run <code>$ git status</code> (or whatever similar functionality you have in your GUI), you should see that some changes have been made. Push our changes to the remote's <code>facelift</code> branch. The edit will now only be seen in readme.md on the <code>facelift</code> branch and not in any of the others.
